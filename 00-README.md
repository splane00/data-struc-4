Project structure:
- 0-driver.py           : main entrypoint (CLI)
- 0-quicksort.py        : iterative quicksort variants (4)
- 0-insertion.py        : insertion sort helper (subrange)
- 0-natural_merge.py    : linked-list natural merge sort (iterative)
- 0-counters.py         : shared comparisons/exchanges counters
- 0-rng.py              : deterministic RNG + Fisher–Yates shuffle
- 0-io_utils.py         : file I/O, input generation, validation, checksum
- 0-inputs/             : (you create; generated by 'gen' command)
- 0-outputs/            : (you create; populated by 'run' command)

Build/Run:
1) Generate inputs (creates 15 files across sizes 50, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000; orders asc/desc/rand):
   python driver.py gen inputs

2) Run all 5 sorts on all inputs, writing outputs:
   python driver.py run inputs outputs

Output conventions:
- For n=50:
  * Output file contains labeled header, full echo of raw input, and full sorted data.
- For n>50:
  * Output file contains labeled header and a concise input echo:
    input count, sum, xor, plus head(20)/tail(20). This honors the guideline
    to echo input while also honoring the lab instruction not to print full sorted data.

Errors:
- Any read/parse issues (blank lines, non-integers) produce a sidecar file:
  outputs/READ_ERRORS_{n}_{order}.txt (sorting still proceeds with valid ints).
- If a sorted result fails validation, an ERROR_sort_*.txt file is emitted.

Notes on “No libraries”:
- Only 'sys' is imported (standard I/O) to read command-line arguments.

Enhancements:
- Deterministic RNG + Fisher–Yates (reproducible random inputs).
- Concise echo for large inputs with checksum for cross-environment validation.
- Full adherence to “iterative vs recursive” parity for fair comparison.
