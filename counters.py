"""
Data Structures Lab 4 (Sorting) â€” Counters

Purpose:
    Lightweight counters shared by all algorithms to track:
    - comparisons: key-to-key comparisons
    - exchanges:   element swaps (arrays) or pointer relinks/moves (linked lists)

Notes:
    Keeping counters in a dedicated module improves cohesion and clarity.
